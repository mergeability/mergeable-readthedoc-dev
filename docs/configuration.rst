Configuration
=====================================

**Mergeable** is **highly** configurable.

First, you'll need to start by creating a ``.github/mergeable.yml`` file in your repository.

.. hint::
  Check out our :ref:`recipes-page` page for examples and most commonly used settings

Next, we'll go into how the configuration is structured.

Basics
------------------

Mergeable configuration consists of an array of independent recipes where each recipe needs to have the following properties:

when:
    specify webhook event(s) in which to process the validation
validate:
    specify a series of validator to be checked
pass:
    specify a series of action to execute if the validation suite returned a `pass`
fail:
    specify a series of action to execute if the validation suite returned a `fail`
error:
    specify a series of action to execute if the validation suite returned a `error`

Here is a full example of how a recipe looks

.. code-block:: yml

    version: 2
    mergeable:
      - when: {{event}}, {{event}} # can be one or more
        validate:
          # list of validators. Specify one or more.
          - do: {{validator}}
            {{option}}: # name of an option supported by the validator.
              {{sub-option}}: {{value}} # an option will have one or more sub-options.
        pass: # list of actions to be executed if all validation passes. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
          - do: {{action}}
        fail: # list of actions to be executed when at least one validation fails. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
          - do: {{action}}
        error: # list of actions to be executed when at least one validator throws an error. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
          - do: {{action}}

.. note::
    There are some default actions that'll be automatically applied based on the events specified

Validators
------------

Validators are checks that mergeable will process in order to determine whether an action should be executed.

.. note::
    Each validator have certain events that it can support, so keep an eye out for them.

.. _organisation-wide-defaults:

Organisation-wide defaults
---------------------------

You can specify a default configuration to be applied across your GitHub organisation.
This can help reduce how many configuration files you need to maintain and make it easier
to get started with Mergeable.

To add a default configuration:

1. Create a repository called `.github` in your organisation.
2. Create a file with the path `.github/mergeable.yml` in this repository.

The final path of the file (including the repo name) should be `<YOUR_ORG>/.github/.github/mergeable.yml`

Mergeable will now use this file as the default when it cannot find one in a given
repository or PR. It determines the file to use in the following order:

1. A `mergeable.yml` inside the PR.
2. A `mergeable.yml` inside the repository the PR is for.
3. A `mergeable.yml` at `<YOUR_ORG>/.github/.github/mergeable.yml`.

Why the weird default file path?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Probots library that Mergeable uses automatically searches for config files
in a repo named `.github` within the organisation.

The double nesting of the `<YOUR_ORG>/.github/.github/mergeable.yml` default
file is unfortunately necessary. The GitHub app permissions model only lets you
specify a single path for your probot to access, so it must be the same as in
regular repositories.
